AMBUSH
Monster is set to ambush players: The monster will not start chasing the player after hearing player weapons until it has a direct line of sight to him (after being woken up, however, it does not need to be facing him). Normally this is set in an editor on a per-object basis. Note that some editors call this flag "Deaf," but this is a misnomer.
The monster can still hear the player with this flag set!
